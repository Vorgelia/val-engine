Specialized for Fighting Games

Libraries used:
GLM http://glm.g-truc.net
GLEW http://glew.sourceforge.net/
GLFW http://www.glfw.org/
SOIL http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html
Boost http://www.boost.org/
Freetype 2 https://www.freetype.org/
FMTlib http://fmtlib.net
Libraries planned to be used:
IrrKlang

Structured to depend on global variables and functions in namespaces.
Having global access to things like Input, Time, OpenGL states, etc was the most intuitive decision.
Somewhat error-prone for group projects, but more than manageable and convenient for a one-person project.
Also included are unnecessary attempts at memory management as personal exercises.

----Arbitrary to-do list----
-Engine Features
TODO: Find a way to multithread input so inputs are received and timed properly on sub-60FPS.
TODO: Add more customization over cleaning up framebuffers between frames.
TODO: Check if a framebuffer was used last frame before cleaning it up.
TODO: Add error checking to Network classes.
-Cleanup and Efficiency
TODO: Clean up includes. Change default function parameters to be defined in .h and not .cpp.
TODO: Change some class variables to be private with getters.
TODO: Replace some instances of map with unordered_map.

	{
		//Aaand this is the main game loop. 
		//There's two kinds of updates to keep track of. Loop updates, that just refer to a single iteration of the above loop running, and game updates, which refer to the fixed frame game state updates.

		//This is a fighting game, so we want a fixed game update rate of 60 per second. This isn't as simple as it might sound since a loop update might take much more or much less than 1/60th of a second.
		//The current approach is as follows: Check how long it's been since the last loop update, update enough times for that time to be less than 1/60th of a second.

		//It is crucial to note that every engine that isn't specialized on something as timing-precise as this one just updates as frequently as possible, while scaling timed operations
		//by the amount of time that passed between frames. For instance, on a frame that takes 2/60 seconds:
		//----OTHER ENGINE: Advance states like animations and movement at speed*2/60 -> render
		//----VAL ENGINE: Advance states like animations and movement at speed*1/60 -> repeat once -> render
		//And on a frame that takes 1/120 seconds.
		//----OTHER ENGINE: Advance states at speed*1/120
		//----VAL ENGINE: Do nothing until it's time to update, which is at another 1/120 seconds

		//This is because fighting games are generally perceived as working on frames, with no middle states in between. It's easier for a designer to specify a move lasting 4 frames
		//and have it concrete and easy to understand, rather than saying a move lasts 0.06666666 seconds and eeeeeh it depends on when we update.

		//It's also of note that physics engines also operate on fixed update rates just to maintain precision on lower framerates.

		UpdateComponents();//Some parts of the engine like timekeeping have to update as frequently as possible, regardless of whether it's game update time.

		bool updatedFrame = false;//This is a variable that keeps track of whether we've run a game update on this iteration. If we have, this will tell the engine to render at the end.
