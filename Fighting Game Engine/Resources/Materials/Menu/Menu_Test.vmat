//Hello~ It's me again, val's awful proprietary format. We're well on our way to becoming best friends.
//I hope you've figured out by now, comments are only supported when they take up the entire line. Booooriiiiing.
//Properties bitmask. Maybe one day i'll let people add it in binary.
//Bits: 8 Cull, 4 Blend, 2 ZTest, 1 ZWrite
#PROPERTIES
	properties=3
	shader=Shaders/Base/2D
#UNIFORM_VEC4
	ve_color=1,1,1,1
#UNIFORM_TEX
	tex0=Textures/tex.png
	.properties=0,0,1,1
//These properties have to do with moving and scaling the texture when drawing with this material
//Translation X , Translation Y , Scaling X, Scaling Y
//I'm really boring so properties are initialized as 0,0,1,1 when the texture uniform is read, then
//properties: xxxx sends properties to the last texture that was read.
